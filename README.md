ðŸ’³ Amazon Sales Dashboard ðŸ“Š

**Project's Objective:**
To develop a dynamic and interactive dashboard that visualizes Amazon sales data, enabling stakeholders to analyse sales performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

**Steps Followed:**

1. *Data Collection*: Collected Amazon Sales Data to serve as the foundation for a thorough analysis.
2. *Data Cleaning*: Ensured the data's accuracy & reliability by carefully cleaning and validating it using Excel & MySQL.
3. *Data Modelling*: Created a strong data model to establish effective relationships between different data sets.
4. *Power Query*: Used Power Query in Power BI to transform raw data into meaningful insights.
5. *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)*: Utilized DAX to perform calculations and derive valuable insights from the data.
6. *Measures*: Developed customized measures and calculations to uncover trends and patterns.
7. *Charts*: Created visually engaging charts that clearly represent complex store data.
8. *Filters*: Applied filters and slicers to allow users to explore data based on specific criteria.
9. *Tooltips*: Implemented tooltips in my Power BI project to enhance interaction with the sales data.

**Useful Insights:**
- Overall revenue: 89.08M

- Total Units Sold: 105K
- Total Orders: 104K
- Bengaluru customers are contributing the most in revenue.
- Very small fraction of orders are Cancelled as compared to total orders received.

-> Recommendation: 
After analysing the data, it is observed that Bengaluru City and Maharashtra State customers are the highest spenders. It's important to focus on sending inventory to Fulfilment Centres in these locations to improve delivery speed.
